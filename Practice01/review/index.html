<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading too!</h2>
<h3>This is also a Heading!</h3>
<h4>This just goes on...</h4>
<h5>and on..</h5>
<h6>till h6!</h6>

<p>This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here: <br>
and continues...</p>

<p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
instance you can make words <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>important</strong>, <em>italicc</em>, <em>emphasized</em>, <font size="1">small...</font><br>
<a style="color:yellow;">the</a> <del>list</del> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.</p>

<p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em;">Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other<br>
    time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that<br>
    we seek.</p>

<!--not to mention how easy commenting is in html-->

<a style="color:blue;"><font size="5"><u>This is a link tag which u can click to navigate to a good song.<br />
You can wrap anything you want in a link tag; here's an image for example.</u></font></a>

<p>here's an input field</p>
<img src="index.jpg" width="300" height="600" />
This is a table

<table width="200" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Head1</td>
    <td>Head2 </td>
    <td>Head3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This</td>
    <td>Is</td>
    <td>How</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You</td>
    <td>Create</td>
    <td>Tables</td>
  </tr>
</table>
This is a list!
this kind of list is called an unordered list.

Ordered Lists!
As you can see it is marked with numbers.

Blocks and Inline Elements
A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
and take up the full width available.
And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.

Now head over to the version with css and see how powerful css is!
